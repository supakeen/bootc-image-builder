# `@osbuild/bootc-image-builder-action`

GitHub Action for building ISOs and disk images for
[Bootable Containers](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/).

## Scope

This action is intended to be a near 1:1 mapping of the
[Bootc Image Builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder/) project.
It is not interested in providing additional features or functionality beyond
what is provided Bootc Image Builder, and therefore these features should be
implemented in the upstream project itself. A few exceptions may be made on a
case-by-case basis.

## Usage

An ISO can be built using the following workflow snippet:

```yaml
- name: Build ISO
  id: build-iso
  uses: osbuild/bootc-image-builder-action@vX.Y.Z
  with:
    config-file: ./iso-config.toml
    image: quay.io/fedora/fedora-silverblue:latest
    types: |
      iso

- name: Upload Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: iso
    path: ${{ steps.build-iso.outputs.output-directory }}
    if-no-files-found: error
```

## Inputs

### `config-file`

Path to the configuration file.

### `image`

The image to use for building the ISO.

### `builder-image` (optional)

The image to use for building the ISO.

Default: `quay.io/centos-bootc/bootc-image-builder:latest`

### `additional-args` (optional)

Additional arguments to pass to Bootc Image Builder. This can be used to enable
experimental features or to pass additional arguments not natively supported by
this action.

### `chown` (optional)

The user and group to use for the output directory. In the form of `user:group`.

### `rootfs` (optional)

The root filesystem to use for the disk image.

### `tls-verify` (optional)

Whether to verify TLS certificates.

Default: `true`

### `types` (optional)

The types of artifacts to build. Can be any type supported by
[osbuild/bootc-image-builder](https://github.com/osbuild/bootc-image-builder).

Default: `qcow2`

Note: Only non-cloud types are currently tested.

### `aws-ami-name` (optional)

The name of the AMI to create. Required when an `ami` type is requested.

### `aws-region` (optional)

The region to create the AMI in. Required when an `ami` type is requested.

### `aws-bucket` (optional)

The name of the S3 bucket to upload the AMI to. Required when an `ami` type is
requested.

## Outputs

### `output-directory`

The directory containing the built artifacts. Files will be nested in
subdirectories based on the type of artifact.

### `output-paths`

A JSON array of the paths to the built artifacts.
